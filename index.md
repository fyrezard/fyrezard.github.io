## About me

Hi.  My name's Fyrezard aka Fyre and my main fursona -- as implied from the name -- is a blue-maned, brown Charizard. See my ref: <https://fyrezard.com/ref1.png>

My other fursona is a pink pooltoy crocodile, see him here: <https://fyrezard.com/ref2.ping>

It's fun to have friends!

Also, this is a better way to host my blog rather than pay $12/mo for WP hosting.  Cheapskate, I know :)

Contact (hopefully doing it this way curbs the spam lol):
